# nautica-downloader
download files from nautica (ksm.dev)

# Usage


```bash
node nautica-downloader.js # download all songs
node nautica-downloader.js --user [user id/slug] # download all songs uploaded by a given user
node nautica-downloader.js --song [song id] # donwload a specific song
```

This will create a `nautica` directory in the same place where the script is ran and download songs into there. 

Replace `node nautica-downloader.js` with `nautica-downloader.exe` if using a distributed version.
